# DunneFlow — briefing

**Read this first, then stop.** It is an index, not a fourth copy of the documentation.
It exists so a fresh context can be useful in a few minutes instead of an hour.

| Read | For |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | The rules. 27 engineering rules and 21 dashboard design rules, each earned from a false result on real code. **Binding.** |
| `HANDOFF.md` | The chronological record — what was built when, what it cost, what broke. ~1,150 lines. Read *sections*, not the whole thing. |
| **this file** | Where things are, what is done, what we are doing now, what not to re-open. |
| Artifact `f993d319-d2b7-4217-9130-cdbba698d1bc` | The ratified dashboard design — a complete working UI, the source of truth for every view. Read it with the **Artifact tool**, not from a screenshot. |

---

## What the tool is

Maps what moves through a program: where it starts, what it runs, what it touches, and
why. **What moves is the subject; internal computation is not.** Local variables,
arithmetic and control flow are deliberately absent — leaving them out is most of what
makes the output readable.

The reader is someone who **reads code but does not write it**, orienting in a codebase
they did not build. Judge every change by whether it helps them orient, not by how many
pages it emits.

## Where the code lives

```
source ──► extract ──► graph.db ──► resolve ──► render (Markdown + Mermaid)
docs   ──► extract ──► docs.db  ──────ATTACH──┘
                       source.db  (file bodies, content-addressed)
```

| Module | What it is |
|---|---|
| `schema.py` | The fact contract. Every extractor in any language emits these types. |
| `store.py` | SQLite. **The spine, not an export format.** Nothing holds the program in memory. |
| `docstore.py` | `docs.db` — parallel to the graph, never inside it. |
| `sourcedb.py` | `source.db` — file bodies. The one store that is never discarded (rule 25). |
| `extractors/python/` | stdlib `ast` + `tokenize` only. No third-party parser. |
| `extractors/docs/` | Markdown / rST / text, scanned by hand. No markdown library. |
| `detectors/*.yaml` | **The extension point.** Teach a framework here, not in code. |
| `resolve/` | Call graph, CLI trees, flows, naming, glossary, traceability, mirror. |
| `render/` | Markdown and Mermaid, complete — never abbreviated (rule 8). |
| `anomalies.py` | What looks wrong. Every finding states what would make it a false alarm. |
| `sql.py` | Reads schemas out of the `CREATE TABLE` statements the code contains. |

### `web/` — and the two applications inside it

The dashboard is **vanilla JS + deck.gl on stdlib `http.server`**. No Node, no framework,
no build step. deck.gl is vendored into `web/vendor/`.

| File | Belongs to |
|---|---|
| `serve.py` | server — route table, one handler per endpoint |
| `queries.py` | every dashboard query as **SQL text**, in one place |
| `cover.py` · `detail.py` · `documents.py` | the cover · the inspector · document mode |
| `graph.py` · `layout.py` | the 2.5D model and where things sit |
| `static/shell.js` | **the dashboard application** — ratified design, reads the store |
| `static/graph.js` | **the graph application** — the 2.5D engine |
| `static/settings.js` · `shading.js` · `inspector.js` | the graph application's parts |
| `static/tokens.css` · `style.css` | the token stylesheet; **no colour is declared outside it** |

> **The central fact of the current work:** those are *two complete applications that have
> never been joined*. Each works. `index.html` loads only `shell.js`, so the graph engine
> is not reached at all — deck.gl is never fetched and there are zero canvases on the page.
> Chunk 2 makes them one.

## Built, and not

Working and verified against Society of Mensores (623 files, 184k lines):

Python extraction · call resolution incl. inheritance and CLI registration idioms · CLI
command trees · flows · boundaries · data structures · database read/write matrix ·
network with timeouts and retries · messaging · anomalies with severity, confidence and
blind spots · Markdown + Mermaid · documentation ingest · glossary · naming standard ·
traceability across both stores · named artefacts · the mirror · comments (18,208 of
18,208) · constants and type aliases · stable identity · source sidecar.

**Dashboard:** the 2.5D graph (60 fps at every measured load) and the ratified shell
(cover, navigator, worklist, reading from the store) — both built, **not yet joined**.

**Not built:** `dunneflow infer` (the model pass) · temporal layers · attestation · the
project profile · document mode's narrative view · packaging as a binary · any language
but Python.

## What we are doing now — chunk 2, "one application"

Unify the two applications, then package. In order:

1. this briefing
2. the stack mounted inside the shell — one state, one settings store, one self-check
3. one inspector — the shell's renderer fed by `/api/node`
4. the package overview repaired as a *layout*, from real aggregated data
5. the graph follows the theme — light palette derived from the CSS tokens
6. re-measure, look at every view in both themes, record

Deferred deliberately: packaging into a double-clickable app; the layered
"stack of architecture drawings" layout (`HANDOFF.md` 5b); temporal layers.

## Decided — do not re-open these

| Decision | Where it is recorded |
|---|---|
| The dashboard is the parent; the graph is a view inside it, **no iframe** | `HANDOFF.md` "Chunk 2, next" |
| `graph.js` is the engine, renamed not removed | same |
| Astro 5 + Tailwind 4 **struck**; vanilla + deck.gl, no Node | `CLAUDE.md` dashboard preamble |
| SQLite is the spine — never replaced with in-memory graphs | `CLAUDE.md` Architecture |
| `docs.db` stays parallel to `graph.db`, never inside it | same |
| **Both** a package graph and the 2.5D stack; the SVG is not the endpoint | `HANDOFF.md` "Opening screen", "Wanted later" |
| The graph follows the theme — both palettes, a Setting, usage retires the loser | `HANDOFF.md`; design rule 2 |
| One multiplier resizes everything, **graph nodes included** | design rule 3 |
| The legend is HTML, 51 disks in three interleaved columns, the main way in | design rule 19 |
| Edges on demand only, and only when still; **one** hop | design rule 19 |
| Confidence is shape, not colour; external is neither | design rule 5; rule 26 |
| Settings persist per program, versioned, discarded whole on mismatch | `settings.js` preamble |
| Route from a table; self-check derived from the DOM | design rule 16 |
| Egress is scoped, never a switch; nothing infers during `analyze` | design rule 14 |
| DunneFlow **never** talks to a VCS to fetch code | `HANDOFF.md` "Version control must stay pluggable" |
| A single binary is the product; sqlite-wasm is the *export* format | `HANDOFF.md` "Distribution" |

## How to verify — all three, before saying anything is done

```bash
uv run pytest        # all tests
uv run mypy .        # src must be clean
uv run ruff check .  # must pass
```

Then against real code, because unit tests on a toy program cannot catch a resolution
defect that only appears at scale:

```bash
uv run dunneflow analyze ../mensores-overhaul/src --name mensores
uv run dunneflow serve output/mensores
```

**`../mensores-overhaul` is read-only.** All output belongs in `output/`.

Ground truth is in `CLAUDE.md` — both halves. Positive: the four executables must all
appear in "Where to start" with plausible reach. Negative, and it matters more:
`.groma/research/v0.2/conventions-naming-and-documentation.md` is a paper *about* naming
standards and must yield **zero** naming rules.

### Three habits this project paid for

- **Look, don't only test.** Two defects in two sessions passed every scripted check and
  were obvious in one screenshot — a graph running at 60 fps under an opaque panel, and a
  filter strip announcing a slice over a view filtering nothing. Screenshot the UI.
- **Doubt the tool first.** On the first run against live code, *six confident findings in
  a row were defects in DunneFlow*, not in the program being read.
- **Assert your inputs.** Three bugs in one day came from a step that silently operated on
  the wrong input and reported success. A string replacement that matches nothing is the
  most expensive kind of edit.

## Shared library

This project consumes `github.com/aacloudguy/dunnecorp-shared` (local checkout
`../SharedCode`). **Check its `catalog.json` before writing any new utility, helper,
workflow, skill or template.** Read it freely; never write there without asking.
