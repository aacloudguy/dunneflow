# DunneFlow — briefing

**Read this first, then stop.** It is an index, not a fourth copy of the documentation.
It exists so a fresh context can be useful in a few minutes instead of an hour.

| Read | For |
|---|---|
| `CLAUDE.md` | The rules. 51 engineering rules and 26 dashboard design rules, each earned from a false result on real code. **Binding.** |
| `HANDOFF.md` | The chronological record — what was built when, what it cost, what broke. ~1,700 lines. Read *sections*, not the whole thing. |
| **this file** | Where things are, what is done, what we are doing now, what not to re-open. |
| Artifact `f993d319-d2b7-4217-9130-cdbba698d1bc` | The ratified dashboard design — a complete working UI, the source of truth for every view. Read it with the **Artifact tool**, not from a screenshot. |

---

## What the tool is

Maps what moves through a program: where it starts, what it runs, what it touches, and
why. **What moves is the subject; internal computation is not.** Local variables,
arithmetic and control flow are deliberately absent — leaving them out is most of what
makes the output readable.

The reader is someone who **reads code but does not write it**, orienting in a codebase
they did not build. Judge every change by whether it helps them orient, not by how many
pages it emits.

## Where the code lives

```
source ──► extract ──► graph.db ──► resolve ──► render (Markdown + Mermaid)
docs   ──► extract ──► docs.db  ──────ATTACH──┘
                       source.db  (file bodies, content-addressed)
```

| Module | What it is |
|---|---|
| `schema.py` | The fact contract. Every extractor in any language emits these types. |
| `store.py` | SQLite. **The spine, not an export format.** Nothing holds the program in memory. |
| `docstore.py` | `docs.db` — parallel to the graph, never inside it. |
| `sourcedb.py` | `source.db` — file bodies. The one store that is never discarded (rule 25). |
| `extractors/python/` | stdlib `ast` + `tokenize` only. No third-party parser. |
| `extractors/docs/` | Markdown / rST / text, scanned by hand. No markdown library. |
| `detectors/*.yaml` | **The extension point.** Teach a framework here, not in code. |
| `resolve/` | Call graph, CLI trees, flows, naming, glossary, traceability, mirror. |
| `render/` | Markdown and Mermaid, complete — never abbreviated (rule 8). |
| `anomalies.py` | What looks wrong. Every finding states what would make it a false alarm. |
| `sql.py` | Reads schemas out of the `CREATE TABLE` statements the code contains. |

### `web/` — one application

The dashboard is **vanilla JS + deck.gl on stdlib `http.server`**. No Node, no framework,
no build step. deck.gl is vendored into `web/vendor/`.

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `serve.py` | the server — a route table, one handler per endpoint |
| `queries.py` | every dashboard query as **SQL text**, in one place |
| `cover.py` · `detail.py` · `documents.py` | the cover · the inspector and the hover card · document mode |
| `threads.py` | adjacency by *interest* — why a neighbour is worth a detour |
| `vocabulary.py` | the naming and glossary lanes, served and matched against one name |
| `graph.py` · `layout.py` | the 2.5D model, and where things sit |
| `packages.py` | the package overview — the other graph layout |
| `static/shell.js` | **the application**: state, routing, every view, the self-check |
| `static/graph.js` | **the engine**: payload to pixels, and nothing about this page |
| `static/settings.js` | the store — per program, versioned |
| `static/shading.js` | the sphere shading, one extension class per lighting |
| `static/tokens.css` | the tokens; **no colour is declared outside this file** |

> **The boundary that matters** is the container. The engine draws inside the element it is
> handed and touches no DOM outside it; what it has to say — selection, counts, fps,
> diagnostics, errors — leaves as events. The shell owns the selection, the settings, the
> search, the legend and the breadcrumb. Before chunk 2 both halves existed twice, and
> `index.html` loaded only one of them.

## Built, and not

Working and verified against Society of Mensores (623 files, 184k lines):

Python extraction · call resolution incl. inheritance and CLI registration idioms · CLI
command trees · flows · boundaries · data structures · database read/write matrix ·
network with timeouts and retries · messaging · anomalies with severity, confidence and
blind spots · Markdown + Mermaid · documentation ingest · glossary · naming standard ·
traceability across both stores · named artefacts · the mirror · comments (18,208 of
18,208) · constants and type aliases · stable identity · source sidecar.

**Dashboard:** one application — the ratified shell (cover, navigator, worklist, table,
document, glossary, naming, settings) with the 2.5D stack and the package overview as two
layouts inside graph mode, one inspector reading `/api/node`, and the graph following the
theme. The reading loop: the navigator is the routine list grouped by package, hovering a
node gives a card, picking one lights its hop and fills the inspector, threads lead sideways,
and ⌘Z takes any of it back. **Finding and keeping your place**: an arrow at the plate's rim
aimed at what you picked and clickable to go there, a reticule on it, a *focus* lock so only
the lit set answers a hover or a click, and *you are here* to restore the view you found it
in.

**Reading one node:** hovering a routine in the picture *or in the navigator* gives a card,
painted in two stages, leading with the **invocation line** — the name, its arguments with
their types, and what comes back. `Enter` over a card opens a **detail window**: callers left,
the routine between, callees right, what it touches, threads leading away; every name is a
hop, and every hop is an ordinary selection so the stack, the navigator, the trail and undo
all follow. `?view=detail` puts that window in a **second tab or window**, two peers in
bidirectional sync over a `BroadcastChannel`.

**Code viewing:** `source.db` is a content-addressed, compressed sidecar (626 files, 7.8 MB
of text in 3.1 MB). The inspector opens a definition ±3 lines from `/api/node`; the glossary's
citation viewer opens any span from `/api/source`. Both say the source is *as measured*, not
as the tree stands now. No file browser, no search inside source, no highlighting — see
`HANDOFF.md` 5s, and the code browser is the next thing to be built.

**Not built:** `dunneflow infer` (the model pass) · temporal layers, and therefore **any
second point in time**: `source.db` holds one snapshot, so a time selector and a diff screen
belong to the layer work rather than to the code browser · attestation · the project profile ·
document mode's narrative view · a file browser or source search · packaging as a binary ·
any language but Python.

**Built but not on screen:** `CURIOSITIES`. `threads.py` computes the outlier family per
package already — most commented, most called, deepest closure, most lopsided table — and
running that program-wide is most of design rule 15's doorway panel. It says honestly that it
is not computed yet.

## What we are doing now

**Paused 2026-08-29 with the reading surfaces worked over end to end.** Everything in this
session came from Tom at the keyboard, most of it from screenshots; see `HANDOFF.md` 5t.

- **A reticule to aim with** in place of deck.gl's hand, which covered the node being aimed
  at. Deliberately not the selection reticule — that one has a ring.
- **The navigator answers with a card**, not the browser's tiny `title` tooltip. One
  component, two hosts; anchored beside the pane, because in a list the *row* is the
  subject's position.
- **The invocation line** — what moves in and what comes back out — on both cards, and one
  renderer (`schema.signature_parts`) for it and the Markdown documents.
- **A detail window**, opened with `Enter` over a card: callers, the routine, callees, what
  it touches, threads. Every hop is an ordinary selection, so the stack, the trail and undo
  all follow.
- **Detached to a second window or tab** (`?view=detail`), two peers over a
  `BroadcastChannel` in bidirectional sync. **This is the pattern the code viewer will use.**
- **Table mode**: 2,418 ms → 46 ms, a resize that now resizes, a header that stays, and a
  strip saying which row is yours.

**Six of this session's defects were controls wired perfectly to a stylesheet or a layout
that could not carry them**, and every automated check on the page passed for all six. That
is the shape to watch for; rules 48–51 are what came out of it.

**Next, and named: the code browser.** Society is to be pulled fresh first, which makes the
temporal question concrete for the first time.

- *What exists*: `source.db` holds 626 files content-addressed, `/api/source?path&first&last`
  serves any span or a whole file, and every routine carries `file`, `line_start`,
  `line_end`. A browser with clickable names syncing both ways is the detached-window
  pattern again.
- *What does not*: any second point in time. `source.db` holds **one** snapshot, so the
  time selector and the diff screen are the layer work rather than a feature of the browser.
  Build the browser against today's snapshot; the layers then add a selector to a working
  view instead of inventing both at once.

**Still owed from before, unchanged:** `CURIOSITIES`; the worklist's two jump buttons (a
server change — `anomalies.py` carrying the node ids it already knows, and I sized it: most
detectors already select the id and three genuinely cannot, which gives those a *better*
disabled reason); the two vocabulary-lane precision defects; packaging as a binary. One
question is open on the worklist and was never answered: **what is an occurrence for
LOST_EDGE** — the 142 callers, or the rival definitions? 93 of Mensores' 106 findings are
LOST_EDGE, so it decides the feature.

**Owed and still not looked at:** the blank-graph fix (rule 49). The automation tab never
mounts the graph — `canvas MISSING`, `frames 0` — so it is reasoned and guarded, not seen.

## What we were doing before that

**The navigator, before the orientation work — 2026-08-28/29.** The three symptoms Tom gave
at the keyboard are `HANDOFF.md` 5o, and the two rules they earned are 45 and 46.

**The glossary and naming pages are ported — 2026-08-28.** See `HANDOFF.md` 5n. They were the
last two screens admitting to being unported: both lanes were computed, tested and served, and
the two views were still the prototype's, written against a shape the server does not send. A
convention is followable by its `glob` (rule 41), a term shows however many senses anything
said about it, a citation opens from `/api/source`, and the lane sizes ride with the cover.
**Rule 44** came out of it: a live control reading a field the server does not send renders
`NaN` at zero width beside a claim that is true, and nothing throws.

**The pop-up and the threads are built — 2026-08-28.** See `HANDOFF.md` 5l–5m.

- **The pop-up is a card, painted in two stages.** `getTooltip` is gone; the engine emits a
  `hover` event and the shell draws. The first paint is free from the payload — name,
  qualified name, `file:line`, plate, `3← 5→` — and `/api/hover` fills in the lines, the
  comment count, what it touches grouped and named, the governance ids and one line of WHY
  with the label saying whether it came from a docstring, a leading comment or a quotation.
- **Threads to pull are computed, in four kinds**: governance kin, the other end of a
  boundary, outliers nearby, and vocabulary. Every one carries a **subject** the router acts
  on, ordered rarest-first, with the count beside it. What they replaced was six hand-written
  rows about one routine, every one of which went to the same empty page.
- **Following a neighbour is a Setting** (design rule 2): `replace` starts a fresh hop,
  `walk` keeps the path lit. Both built, ⌘Z drops the last hop, and the walked length is
  stated.
- **`/api/naming` and `/api/glossary` are served**, computed once at start. The graph uses
  them; the two pages were ported the same day — see above.

**Known and not fixed: the near-plane clipping.** Zooming far enough in clips the nodes
nearest the camera. It is deck.gl's default frustum, the diagnosis is in `graph.js`, and the
obvious remedy — a negative `near`, which is geometrically sound under an orthographic
projection — **breaks pan and zoom**. Do not retry it without a way to drive the controls.
Rule 39.

### And before that

**Chunk 2, "one application" — done 2026-08-28.** The two applications are one: the stack
mounts inside the shell, there is one state, one settings store, one inspector and one
self-check; the package overview is computed rather than hand-placed and sits beside the
stack as a *layout*; and the graph follows the theme. See `HANDOFF.md` 5d for what it cost
and what it found — including that the sphere shading had never actually run.

**Next: packaging.** A single double-clickable binary is the product, and not for
convenience: DunneFlow reads private source and `source.db` contains it, so a hosted model
would send an unfamiliar codebase to a server, and design rule 14 says egress is scoped and
never a switch. PyInstaller or py2app, opens at localhost, full SQLite underneath, no Node.
Signing decides the experience, and there is already an Apple Developer account.

Deferred deliberately: the layered "stack of architecture drawings" layout (`HANDOFF.md`
5b); temporal layers; attestation; `dunneflow infer`.

**Owed and now discharged:** the two "spheres" rows in the `CLAUDE.md` budget table were
retaken 2026-08-28 — 60 median, nothing dropped, on a 2652×1537 canvas framed with snap to
fit, shading confirmed by eye first. Both the canvas size and the framing are recorded this
time, because their absence is what made the original pair impossible to reproduce.

**Also done 2026-08-28 (`HANDOFF.md` 5g):** the side panes fold to a labelled rail, and
the inspector rails itself while nothing is selected. Found doing it: `panels` had been a
persisted, reset-by-name setting that **nothing read** since the chunk-2 merge. Design rule
24, and design rule 16 extended.

**Also done 2026-08-28 (`HANDOFF.md` 5f):** three independent spread axes (X and Y widen a
plate, Z is the gap between plates; all three together is what zoom already is), and
hide/collapse as separate switches so a selection of eight plates out of fifty-two stops
reading as eight plates down a tower of empty slots. Design rules 22 and 23. **Still owed
from that conversation: per-plate sphere scaling, and stack orientation** — laying the column
on its side, which is structural because `OrbitView` has no camera roll.

**Also done 2026-08-28 (`HANDOFF.md` 5e):** three layout and navigator defects found while
clearing that debt. A `rem` inside `@media` resolves against the browser's font size, not
the page's, so five breakpoints silently meant the wrong width; the narrow layout's
`display: none` lost to a later equal-specificity rule and never hid anything; and all four
navigator routes that set a subject carried no subject, so forty rows did the same nothing.
Rules 28, 29 and 30.

## Decided — do not re-open these

| Decision | Where it is recorded |
|---|---|
| The dashboard is the parent; the graph is a view inside it, **no iframe** | `HANDOFF.md` "Chunk 2, next" |
| `graph.js` is the engine, renamed not removed | same |
| Astro 5 + Tailwind 4 **struck**; vanilla + deck.gl, no Node | `CLAUDE.md` dashboard preamble |
| SQLite is the spine — never replaced with in-memory graphs | `CLAUDE.md` Architecture |
| `docs.db` stays parallel to `graph.db`, never inside it | same |
| **Both** a package graph and the 2.5D stack; the SVG is not the endpoint | `HANDOFF.md` "Opening screen", "Wanted later" |
| The graph follows the theme — both palettes, a Setting, usage retires the loser | `HANDOFF.md`; design rule 2 |
| One multiplier resizes everything, **graph nodes included** | design rule 3 |
| The legend is HTML, 51 disks in three interleaved columns, the main way in | design rule 19 |
| Edges on demand only, and only when still; **one** hop | design rule 19 |
| Confidence is shape, not colour; external is neither | design rule 5; rule 26 |
| Settings persist per program, versioned, discarded whole on mismatch | `settings.js` preamble |
| Route from a table; self-check derived from the DOM | design rule 16 |
| Egress is scoped, never a switch; nothing infers during `analyze` | design rule 14 |
| DunneFlow **never** talks to a VCS to fetch code | `HANDOFF.md` "Version control must stay pluggable" |
| A single binary is the product; sqlite-wasm is the *export* format | `HANDOFF.md` "Distribution" |
| **Nodes are billboarded circles, lit to read as spheres** — the technique, not an approximation | `HANDOFF.md` "why the nodes are flat circles" |
| Edges stay up while the camera turns; a Setting, default on | design rule 19, amended |
| The legend is a **pane with its own track**, never an overlay; open by default | design rule 25 |
| The **navigator is the routine list** — not a split centre pane, not a fourth mode | design rule 26 |
| Selecting never moves the camera; off-screen is *stated* with one click to frame it | design rule 26 |
| Clicking an already-selected node still clears it — undo makes it recoverable | rule 33 |
| The pop-up is a **hover card**; the clickable depth stays in the inspector | `HANDOFF.md` 5l |
| A thread carries a **subject**, never a label; the click routes from a table | rule 30; design rule 16 |
| Threads sort **rarest first** — three routines is a detour, three hundred is a category | `threads.py` |
| Following a neighbour: **both** replace and walk, a Setting, usage retires the loser | design rule 2 |
| The naming and glossary lanes are computed **at start**, not lazily; their bodies are fetched when their page opens, their sizes ride with the cover | `CLAUDE.md` budget; `HANDOFF.md` 5n |
| A citation is opened from `/api/source`, never pinned into the page | `HANDOFF.md` 5n |
| Plates a selection touches are drawn faintly and named, though plates stay off | design rule 26 |
| **Plate**, never disk or plane, in every word a reader sees | `HANDOFF.md` 5p; a guard |
| The you-are-here arrow is a billboard at the plate's rim, aimed by a screen angle | `HANDOFF.md` 5p; rule 22 |
| The way back restores the view the selection was *found* in, not a computed fit | `HANDOFF.md` 5p |
| Clicking the arrow selects that node alone and frames it — it **sets**, never toggles | rule 47; rule 33 |
| Focus separates *what may answer* from *what is drawn*; the fog stays on screen | rule 47; design rule 19 |
| The navigator is a fixed header over a scrolling body; group headings are sticky | rule 45's session; `HANDOFF.md` 5o |
| The routine list is grouped by package, and the package is the **plates'** package | `queries.py` `NAV_ROUTINES`; rule 30 |
| How many routines a package lists is the reader's, `All` included | `HANDOFF.md` 5o |
| A search opens what it matched only while the answer is small, and says when it did not | rule 45 |
| The centre pane's **mode is not part of where you were** — Back restores the subject and leaves you in the mode you are reading in | `HANDOFF.md` 5t; `CENTRE_MODES` |
| The pop-up stays `pointer-events: none`; drilling in is a **key**, never a click on the card | rule 48; `HANDOFF.md` 5l |
| The detail window holds **open or not**, never *which* — it reads the one selection | rule 51 |
| Two windows are **peers over a `BroadcastChannel`**, never opener and child | `HANDOFF.md` 5t |
| A detached view is the **same application** under `?view=detail`, never a second page | `HANDOFF.md` 5t |
| One renderer for a signature, `schema.signature_parts`, for the documents and the card alike | rule 13; `HANDOFF.md` 5t |

## How to verify — all three, before saying anything is done

```bash
uv run pytest        # all tests
uv run mypy .        # src must be clean
uv run ruff check .  # must pass
```

Then against real code, because unit tests on a toy program cannot catch a resolution
defect that only appears at scale:

```bash
uv run dunneflow analyze ../mensores-overhaul/src --name mensores
uv run dunneflow serve output/mensores
```

**`../mensores-overhaul` is read-only.** All output belongs in `output/`.

Ground truth is in `CLAUDE.md` — both halves. Positive: the four executables must all
appear in "Where to start" with plausible reach. Negative, and it matters more:
`.groma/research/v0.2/conventions-naming-and-documentation.md` is a paper *about* naming
standards and must yield **zero** naming rules.

### The traps that cost this session

- **The automation tab gets no animation frames.** `ResizeObserver` never fires and `rAF`
  never ticks in it, so anything needing a rendered frame cannot be observed there — a
  confident, reproducible and entirely false finding came out of measuring through one.
  Static DOM facts (grid tracks, widths, classes) survive; everything else must be driven
  by a human in a real window. Rule 38.
- **A guard that checks a name appears has not checked anything happens.** Three guards
  written this session passed against their own defect first time. Run every new one against
  the defect it came from *and* against a half-working version. Rule 37.
- **A rule about drawing is usually also a rule about reading.** Rule 23 said a shadow is
  never an endpoint; the code that *drew* edges obeyed it and the code that *read* them did
  not, which silently deleted every cross-plate caller from the selection. Rule 31.
- **A guard that names the right case may still not catch it.** `selectionOnScreen()`
  documented itself as returning null when there is no viewport and guarded with `?.` —
  while deck.gl asserts *inside* `getViewports()`. The `?.` was what made it look guarded.
  Rule 42.
- **A check that cries wolf has already failed.** The runtime self-check reported four dead
  controls on every page load for two sessions and was wrong about all four. Rule 43.

- **A scripted click proves the handler, not the path to it.** `element.click()` fires the
  listener whatever is painted on top. A whole session's driving verified every control on
  the detail window and could not see that its scrim was over it. Use `elementFromPoint`.
  Rule 48.
- **Three times now: a control correctly wired to a stylesheet that could not carry it.**
  `[hidden]` beaten by a later `display`, a `th` width ignored under `table-layout: auto`,
  a sticky header bound to a box that never scrolls. Markup and handlers both check out.
- **A guard that passes first time has not been tested.** Twelve did this session. Every one
  was a containment check over too wide a span, or against a name where the claim was about
  a behaviour. Run every new guard against its own defect *and* a half-working version.
- **A comment explaining a defect will trip the check for it.** Three did; `_code()` strips
  comment lines. Its first version stripped string bodies too — which in this codebase is
  where the checked code lives — so every check passed against an empty string.
- **A promise can be printed rather than wired.** Three keyboard badges — `S`, `G`, `T` —
  named keys nothing listened for, and two of them sat on buttons with *no attributes at
  all*. The runtime self-check enumerates `data-*`, so a control carrying none is one it
  cannot see. Design rule 16 one level further out than any check here was looking.
- **A guard that reads past its subject vouches for the wrong thing.** `_fn` stopped at
  `\nfunction` and swallowed the `async function` after it; a badge check took "everything
  after the keydown listener" as the handler. Both passed against their own defects.

Each of these looked like working code and passed every automated check.

- **The nodes are flat circles on purpose.** Billboarded circles lit to *simulate* spheres
  is the performance technique that lets the stack hold ten thousand nodes at full speed —
  it came out of prior research and is not an approximation of something better. The
  lighting is load-bearing: without it they render as coins, not balls. Do not "fix" this
  into real geometry.
- **A shader effect that does nothing is not an error.** Three separate causes did it here
  — an unrecognised inject hook, a GLSL name collision with deck.gl's own scope, and a
  shader never reassembled because deck.gl resolves one per extension *class*. Each
  compiles, each draws. Check by eye after touching the layer.
- **A backtick inside an HTML comment inside a template literal** closes the literal. The
  page comes up blank; nothing else fails. Two guards now catch it.
- **`render()` rewrites the centre pane on every keystroke.** Anything with state of its
  own — a canvas, a colour picker, a slider being dragged — must live outside it or be
  updated narrowly.
- **CSS has four defaults that look like absence and are not.** A `rem` inside `@media`
  silently means the *browser's* font size, not the page's. A media query adds no
  specificity, so its `display: none` loses to any equal selector declared later. A grid
  item is `min-height: auto`, so it refuses to shrink and hands its overflow to the
  document — the first three were live in one stylesheet at once and produced one symptom.
  And a **sticky child sticks to its scroller's padding box**, so a strip of padding there
  is a gap the content scrolls through *above* the header meant to be covering it.
- **`outerWidth`/`outerHeight` are device pixels; `inner*` are CSS pixels.** Mixing them
  made 88px of ordinary browser chrome read as 677px and sent a diagnosis chasing a docked
  panel that did not exist.
- **A check may only claim what its instrument can prove.** The DOM can show a control with
  no handler; it cannot show a handler no control reaches, because half the controls are
  conditional. That direction belongs in a test that reads the source.

### Three habits this project paid for

- **Look, don't only test.** Two defects in two sessions passed every scripted check and
  were obvious in one screenshot — a graph running at 60 fps under an opaque panel, and a
  filter strip announcing a slice over a view filtering nothing. Screenshot the UI.
- **Doubt the tool first.** On the first run against live code, *six confident findings in
  a row were defects in DunneFlow*, not in the program being read.
- **Assert your inputs.** Three bugs in one day came from a step that silently operated on
  the wrong input and reported success. A string replacement that matches nothing is the
  most expensive kind of edit.

## Shared library

This project consumes `github.com/aacloudguy/dunnecorp-shared` (local checkout
`../SharedCode`). **Check its `catalog.json` before writing any new utility, helper,
workflow, skill or template.** Read it freely; never write there without asking.
